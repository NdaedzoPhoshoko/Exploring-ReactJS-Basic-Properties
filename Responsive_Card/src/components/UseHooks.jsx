/**Functions starting with use are called hooks. They are used for sharing data between components.
 * Hooks let you use state and other React features without writing a class.
 * Example useState() method
 * You can write your own hooks using the existing ones, but there are rules.
 * Hooks can only be called from React function components.
 * Hooks can only be called at the top level. You canâ€™t call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
